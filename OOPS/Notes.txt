  OOPS - object oreiented Programming 
 OOP Features 

1. class  - It's is blueprint of an object.
            It is collection of object
            It is type of object
            It is not real entity 
            It has a data member/state and member function/behaviour

      eg. Vehical  - color,price,break,body,no_of_wheels - data members
                      driving - function
          Human  - ear ,eyes ,nose , hands.... - data members 
                        speaking , reading, eating - function 

        Person - id,name,address ,c_no - data members
                  displayDetails , getDetails - member funcitons 




2. object  - It is real entity 
             It is type of class 
              It has it own data and function 
3. inheritance  - parent - child ---- Property of one class can use property of another class - reusability 
                'is a' relationship Employee is Person 
                                    Truck is Vehical
               1. single 
               2. Multilevel
               3. multiple 
               4 Hiearchical
               5 Hybrid

4. Polymorphisum
5. Encalsulation
6. Abstraction

Create class Employee having data eid , name ,salary,department and acept this data from user and display it

Constructor - to initlize object 
             - have same as class name 
            - doesn't return value 
            - called automatecally 
Construvtors vs method 

18th Dec
    OOPS 
      class - blueprint of an object
              data members and member function
              Employee data memebers - id,name,salary,department
                      member functions - display(),getDetails()
              class is nothing until you are creating object of it 
              class is collection of object
    object - type of class
             real entity 

Book class having isbn , title ,autour and price 
- creating constructor to inilize object 



-Destructor 
~classname - release memoery

Lab Task : Use array in Employee class


create class called Shape having one data member called name
1 member function calculateArea which return 0


---> Create a class Product with:

Fields: name, price
Method: displayDetails()


Lab Task ---->
  Phone (brand, model, price) 
Menu driven program 
1. Add Phone
2. View all phone
3. Search phone
4. exit

20th Dec
  class
  object
  inheritance  -- property of one class can use property of another class - resuablility 
                Parent - child

Lab task :  constructor definition 10 write

Inhertiance - 
single    - one parent and one child - one super and one sub
Multilevel  - GrandParent - Parent - Child
Multiple  - Mother/Father - child
Heierchical  - A B --both classes are exteing the C
Hybrid  - mixing of any above 

Lab Task : Hierchical and Hybrid
class A
class B , public A
class C public A


  polymorphisum

23rd Dec 

public , private , protected 

access modifers - 
public - available all over
private - within class only
protected - within subclass 


Polymorphisum --- 
Ability to take more then one form .
More then one form - krish 
addition - 2 numbers  , 5 addtion ,3 float , 2 int & 3 float

2 Types 
1. Compile time/static binding - 
    eg. Method overloading / operator overloading
    Method overloading means method name is same but agrgument/parameters are different
    addition(int,int)
    addition(float,int,float)
    addition(int,float)

Operator Overloading 
12+23
23.67+435
345.546+345345
Person p,p1;

Point p1(2,3)
Point p2(12,23);
add Point(14,26);
p1+p2

2. Runtime - eg Method overriding 

25th Dec 

Operator Overloading  - +,-,*,<,>,!=,.....

1. create class called Point
    having 2 int variable x and y 
    having constructor to initlize x and y
    having display() to display x and y

p3=p1+p2;

p1.operator(p2)

Point operator+(Point other)
{
  .....
  return Point
}

<= 
12<=90 === false
p1<=p2 

27th Dec 
 Overloading - same method name and argument are diffrent  - within same class
 Overriding - same name and same argument  -- within parent-child

virtual function 

Abstraction  --- showing only essential details and hiding other things .
Pure virtual function 

virtual int calculateArea()=0;

Lab Task :
3 classes 
Bank  - calcualteInterest(int amount) -- virtual/pure virtual 
ICICI - override calcualteInterest(int amount) --- it will implemented accouring to ICICI rule 
SBI  - overdide calcualteInterest(int amount) --- implementation 


Encapsulation --- wrapping data and members into single unit
class is use to achive this
data are private and methods are public 


Inline function /Friend function 

inline - within line --control is not passed to function instead it will perform at the place 
-faster execution
-less code 1/2 line 

p.display()
    display ---logic
p1.display()
p3.display()

30th Dec 
 --- Abstraction ? showing only essential detail and hide other details 
                   pure virtual - no body
                    virtual void display()=0;  //pure virtual function
                    virtual void display()
                    {
                      ....
                    }      //virtual function 

--inline - small bock of code within line

friend function - friend class
--shared private /protected data

-->this - refers to the current object 
int c_no;
Person(int c_no)
{
  this->c_no=c_no;
}
  
1st Jan 
  friend  - private and procted data 
  this - referce to the current object

File Handling  - 
    open
    read
    write 
    close

getline 

Labtask : read whole file from another location 
        2. copy file 
        3. data write from console --> jya sudhi END 

3rd Jan

-- > fiend function 
--file handling  --- open ,read ,write ,close ,append,copy

static keyword 
---tops student information 100 -- id,name,address,c_no,course,batch ....location ,copmany name
---employees 1000 --- id,name,address,departmenet,salary 

static is belongs to class not to object  --access thru class with scope resolution :: operator
function 
variable --- initlize only onces


Recursion - function calls itself
