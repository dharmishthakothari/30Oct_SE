  OOPS - object oreiented Programming 
 OOP Features 

1. class  - It's is blueprint of an object.
            It is collection of object
            It is type of object
            It is not real entity 
            It has a data member/state and member function/behaviour

      eg. Vehical  - color,price,break,body,no_of_wheels - data members
                      driving - function
          Human  - ear ,eyes ,nose , hands.... - data members 
                        speaking , reading, eating - function 

        Person - id,name,address ,c_no - data members
                  displayDetails , getDetails - member funcitons 




2. object  - It is real entity 
             It is type of class 
              It has it own data and function 
3. inheritance  - parent - child ---- Property of one class can use property of another class - reusability 
                'is a' relationship Employee is Person 
                                    Truck is Vehical
               1. single 
               2. Multilevel
               3. multiple 
               4 Hiearchical
               5 Hybrid

4. Polymorphisum
5. Encalsulation
6. Abstraction

Create class Employee having data eid , name ,salary,department and acept this data from user and display it

Constructor - to initlize object 
             - have same as class name 
            - doesn't return value 
            - called automatecally 
Construvtors vs method

    OOPS 
      class - blueprint of an object
              data members and member function
              Employee data memebers - id,name,salary,department
                      member functions - display(),getDetails()
              class is nothing until you are creating object of it 
              class is collection of object
    object - type of class
             real entity 

Book class having isbn , title ,autour and price 
- creating constructor to inilize object 



-Destructor 
~classname - release memoery

Lab Task : Use array in Employee class


create class called Shape having one data member called name
1 member function calculateArea which return 0


---> Create a class Product with:

Fields: name, price
Method: displayDetails()


Lab Task ---->
  Phone (brand, model, price) 
Menu driven program 
1. Add Phone
2. View all phone
3. Search phone
4. exit

  class
  object
  inheritance  -- property of one class can use property of another class - resuablility 
                Parent - child

Lab task :  constructor definition 10 write

Inhertiance - 
single    - one parent and one child - one super and one sub
Multilevel  - GrandParent - Parent - Child
Multiple  - Mother/Father - child
Heierchical  - A B --both classes are exteing the C
Hybrid  - mixing of any above 

Lab Task : Hierchical and Hybrid
class A
class B , public A
class C public A


  polymorphisum

23rd Dec 

public , private , protected 

access modifers - 
public - available all over
private - within class only
protected - within subclass 


Polymorphisum --- 
Ability to take more then one form .
More then one form - krish 
addition - 2 numbers  , 5 addtion ,3 float , 2 int & 3 float

2 Types 
1. Compile time/static binding - 
    eg. Method overloading / operator overloading
    Method overloading means method name is same but agrgument/parameters are different
    addition(int,int)
    addition(float,int,float)
    addition(int,float)

Operator Overloading 
12+23
23.67+435
345.546+345345
Person p,p1;

Point p1(2,3)
Point p2(12,23);
add Point(14,26);
p1+p2

2. Runtime - eg Method overriding
